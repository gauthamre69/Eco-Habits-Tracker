Here's a clear and respectful way to frame that recommendation in your presentation, documentation, or even during your viva:

---

###  Deployment Recommendation for Evaluation

To streamline the review process and avoid time-consuming setup:

> **We recommend installing the pre-built `.apk` file directly on an Android device.(app-release.apk)**

This will allow you to:

* Instantly experience the app without needing to install Flutter or set up Firebase manually.
* Interact with all core features including login, habit logging, achievements, and theme switching.
* Get a full user experience just as intended for end users.

---

### ðŸ›  Alternate Option (If Preferred)

If you'd still like to inspect the codebase:

* Weâ€™ve included a full README with setup steps.
* Firebase integration is documented and modular.
* All code is organized and ready to run locally if needed.

Would you like this added directly to your README or presentation document? I can place it in the right section. âœ…
